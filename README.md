# TVShow-Challenge
Api create to introduce my code for a challenge

In this application I use: 

- .Net 6
- EntityFrameworkCore - CodeFirst
- Identity
- Dependency Injection
- Swagger
- Authentication JWT
- WebAPI

I'm apply concepts by SOLID, and arquitecture DDD. To Database I was used SQLServer, when you execute VS the base will be create,
and to populate database I'm create a service to consuming the informations to https://www.episodate.com/api, 
so when you execute the system and doesn't have any datas, the program will populate.

Thanks and regards Gabriela Soares.
